Are you looking for an expert in ML, NLP, and MLOps?  
Are you struggling to integrate and scale your LLMs in production?  
Do you want to gain more control and better performances over your AI features?

I can help you.

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with over 8 years of experience.  
I worked with various industries and companies such as EDF, Saint-Gobain, Safran, or open-source projects like Open Food Facts.

Over my career, I achieved the followings:
 
 🚢 Improved document parsing for a Shipping Insurance Leader in Europe. The quality of extraction went from 42% to 92%. I used NLP techniques such as Name Entity Recognition or Text Classification.

 🍊 Increased by 11% the number of identified ingredients in the Open Food Facts database. The solution consists in a fine-tuned open-source LLM. The deployed feature costs 100x times less than GPT-4o.

 ✨ Led the development of a Recommender System for an American Start-Up. Its purpose? To propose the best incubators to company founders. 

I can help you to:

 - Develop scalable and high quality AI/ML solutions,
 - Ensure error-free and efficient deployments of ML models,
 - Design and build APIs,
 - Deploy an infrastructure to serve models at scale,
 - Optimize ML models running in production for better performance, memory, and throughput.
