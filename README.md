### 🦸‍♂️ Who am I?
After +5 years as a research engineer in France 🐓, I decided in October 2021 to leave everything and start my **entrepreneurial activity**, **learn programming from scratch**, and work with companies **around the world** 🌍.

I document my adventure on **social media**. I tell my story and experience through **podcasts** and **conferences**.

I see life as an **epic adventure**, where I am the hero of my own story, seeking to gain experience points in the range of skills that characterize me.
